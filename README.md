# Digital halftoning using conditional generative adversarial networks

This is an implementation of digital halftoning using cGANs. 
For selected results, please refer to the 'examples' directory.
Halftone images cannot be viewed or saved with lossy compression and needs to be viewed only in magnifications 100%, 200%, 300%, etc.
